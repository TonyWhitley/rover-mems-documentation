# 3-pin 5AS cable

These are green connectors in the car

It seems difficult (impossible) to get green diagnostic side connectors which are TE part 172201-4

You can use the white ECU connector instead: 172201-1 but be mindful that ECU and 5AS work at different voltages, so don't mix up connecting them

There are no pin number markings on these connectors so it is hard to describe the pinout

5AS C61-16 is 5AS RX

5AS C61-24 is 5AS TX
