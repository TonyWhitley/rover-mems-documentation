# 16-pin ECU cable

For ECU only, use a 16-pin diagnostic cable which runs k-line on pin 7

MEMS 3 ECUs can get away without technically, but ideally for those and required for 1.9 and 2J ECUs, make sure the cable can do breaks

FTDI based cables can

Sometimes these cables are sold as Subaru or VW (VAG-kkl) cables, you can use those but make sure they have an FTDI chip inside, or some other type if it supports breaks
