# 3-pin ECU cable

For 1.2, 1.3, 1.6 ECUs only

White connector in the car

A green connector in the car will be for immobiliser and runs at higher voltage, you will probably damage an ECU cable if you plug it into the green connector on a car

Build a 3-pin ECU cable using a 5 volt TTL level USB to serial cable, 3.3 volt serial cables will not work

It does not have to be FTDI

Prolific make some which are fine - PL2303-HXD, avoid PL2303-HXA or others as Prolific purposefully broke the Windows drivers for those, even though (hundreds of) thousands of them are still being used in the world

Diagnostic side connectors are TE part 172201-1, Mouser have approx 1,000 in stock as of writing but they are marked as end-of-life so no more will be made

Diagnostic side pins are TE part 170280-1
